# About Project<br>
This project is an attempt to creat a Library Recod Management System.<br>
Currently it rely on RAM (Random Accesss Memory) for data storage, We are making<br> 
progress to add file based recod system. With this software, you can: <br>
<li> Add new Books <br>
<li> Remove Books <br>
<li> View all Books in the system <br>
<li> Issue Books <br>
<li> Recieve Issued Books<br>
<li> View Issue/Recieved Recod<br>
Moreover we added proper check and balance to every proceedure <br>
to make it less confusing and easy to use.<br>
